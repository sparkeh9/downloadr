### v0.0.1 â€“ Initial release

- **Terminal-first downloader**: Windows/Linux CLI built with .NET and Spectre.Console.
- **Queue ingestion**: Paste CR/CRLF-separated URLs via `downloadr queue` or press A in the live UI.
- **Live top-like UI**: Per-item status, ETA, and adaptive speed units; toggle bytes/bits (U).
- **Controls**:
  - Item: P pause, R resume, C cancel
  - Global: G pause all, H resume all
  - Maintenance: X clear completed/failed/cancelled (removes .part files)
  - Quit: Q
- **Resumable downloads**: Uses `.part` files, HTTP Range with ETag/Last-Modified; safe restart after killing the process.
- **Configurable**:
  - Default download directory and concurrency in `appsettings.json`
  - Override concurrency on launch: `downloadr --parallel 6`
  - Set destination during `queue` or in-UI add flow
- **Startup behaviour**:
  - `downloadr` (no args) shows the live view and continues downloads
  - Options-only invocation (e.g., `--parallel`) maps to the live view
- **Persistence**: Flat-file repository in `data/` (git-ignored). Logs in `logs/`.
- **Versioning**:
  - Default dev: `0.0.0-dev`
  - `--version` prints assembly version
  - Publish script injects version metadata into binaries
- **Packaging**:
  - Executable name: `downloadr`
  - Publish script builds single-file, self-contained binaries for win-x64 and linux-x64, bundles to `dist/downloadr-<rid>-<version>.zip|.tar.gz`
  - `appsettings*.json` included in build/publish outputs

Known notes:
- Live UI suspends briefly when adding URLs to avoid overlapping interactive displays.
- Some servers may not support HTTP Range; such downloads restart from zero automatically.
